# ContainmentBreachVRBlink
Uses the HTC Vive Pro Eye to detect when a user blinks and then simulates a spacebar press. Used for SCP:CB in VR with vorpX

Uses the DirectX spacebar keycode, meant to work with vorpX and the original SCP:CB written in Blitz3D. If you want to use a version of SCP:CB without the default blink timer for use with this program, it can be found here:
